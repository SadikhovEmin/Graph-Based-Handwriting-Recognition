Title: A Fast Matching Algorithm for Graph-Based Handwriting Recognition


Graph-based handwriting recognition was previously used to recognize single character, but could not detect sentences written without removing the pen. The article develops a new algorithm that eliminates this problem. Proposed solution decreases run time complexity from cubic in previously used Hungar-ian algorithm to quadratic time using Hausdro distance. Our aim is to write a research report and if the working principles of the algorithm is clearly understood by the members, then a small handwriting recognition application will be coded.
